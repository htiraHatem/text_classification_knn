october
only
later
return
the
sport
had
rarely
ever
been
full

before
was
very
very
nervous
very
starstruck
joining
european

and

both
veterans

individual
finals
was
nervous
the
start
knight
recalls
legs
were
shaking
much
that
when
they
called
back
after
false
start
thought
was
because
was
moving
the
blocks
instead
was
problem
with
the
starting
gun
the
officials
worked
fix
the
faulty
firearm
knight
watched
armand
duplantis
set
new
pole
vault
world
record
the
field
further
underlining
the
elite
company
she
was
keeping
when
the
race
finally
got
under
way
there
was
simple
remedy
ward
off
any
stage
fright
knight
kept
the
stars
out
sight
and
out
mind
going
out
hard
lead
halfway
think
originally
the
crowd
probably
thought
good
you
for
giving
good
she
says
honest
was
just
kind
waiting
for
them
that
whole
second
lap
was
thinking
where
are
they
cant
feel
them
yet
then
the
last
bend
could
sense
swiety
ersetic
shoulder
the
crowd
were
going
mad
down
the
home
straight
and
was
like
please
hold
please
hold
she
did
knights
victory
was
the
biggest
her
career
far
her
winning
time
seconds
makes
her
the
fourth
fastest
woman
the
world
far
this
strangest
sporting
years
they
werent
expecting
there
adds
knight
was
the
only
one
wearing
club
vest
for
example
they
wouldnt
have
known
name
all
nobody
really
said
anything
else
cooldowns
apart
from
swiety
ersetic
kind
patting
the
shoulder
and
congratulating
would
probably
say
they
were
quite
shocked
because
was
too
jessie
knight
her
way
winning
the
the
glasgow
grand
prix
knight
powered
into
the
lead
glasgow
and
never
looked
back
eight
days
later
she
was
back
the
classroom
with
her
year
six
pupils
danetree
school
ewell
since
her
win
glasgow
they
had
enjoyed
their
half
term
holidays
and
knight
had
enjoyed
follow
victory
the
british
indoor
championships
had
round
applause
walked
she
recalls
they
were
very
excited
they
thought
british
championships
medal
was
real
gold
feel
like
they
are
the
journey
with
they
give
lots
cute
cards
and
messages
and
the
parents
and
school
have
been
supportive
miss
knights
superhero
style
side
hustle
world
class
athlete
was
very
nearly
squeezed
out
before
could
start
her
first
year
the
job
she
attempted
combine
teaching
and
competing
after
just
month
the
workload
proved
too
great
actually
felt
quite
relieved
when
made
that
decision
first
just
because
the
month
doing
both
was
tough
she
says
had
decided
teaching
was
career
that
was
how
was
going
earn
money
and
was
time
grown
she
threw
herself
into
teaching
marking
and
planning
late
into
the
night
the
prospect
cold
lonely
winter
training
sessions
was
easy
ignore
but
come
the
summer
her
athlete
friends
social
media
prepared
race
once
more
the
track
called
her
back
suddenly
realised
let
something
that
was
quite
good
and
really
love
she
adds
she
got
back
contact
with
coach
marina
armstrong
and
got
back
work
she
was
within
four
hundredths
second
making
the
british
team
for
doha
last
year
and
had
hoped
secure
individual
spot
the
hurdles
her
preferred
event
for
the
tokyo
olympics
with
perhaps
relay
role
the
cards
those
plans
like
her
teaching
life
have
been
scattered
the
coronavirus
pandemic
but
knight
knows
that
some
her
achievements
cannot
measured
the
stopwatch
weight
medals
denied
quarantine
and
lockdown
shy
eight
year
old
her
talent
was
spotted
her
own
teacher
bezodis
now
she
the
one
broadening
pupils
possibilities
for
what
they
can
they
know
when
come
really
tired
from
lactic
session
the
night
before
she
adds
make
sure
they
know
not
just
wow
miss
knight
can
run
really
fast
its
actually
miss
knight
works
really
hard
and
now
paying
off
that
good
for
them
learn
for
girls
this
age
not
always
their
favourite
subject
but
think
has
definitely
made
them
think
actually
girls
can
sport
because
some
years
old
dont
always
think
that
they
can
having
role
model
that
involved
with
sport
has
definitely
impacted
them
and
made
them
want
more
feel
quite
passionately
about
sport
well
and
the
positive
impact
had
life
glad
that
get
pass
that
