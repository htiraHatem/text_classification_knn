world
football
global
game
that
connects
almost
every
single
person
the
planet
here
are
reasons
why
world
football
the
best
sport
the
world
passion
surrounding
the
sport
matter
where
you
watch
football
match
one
thing
never
changes
that
one
thing
the
passion
that
everyone
around
the
game
contains
for
football
regardless
what
part
the
world
you
are
the
passion
for
the
sport
remains
the
same
the
same
passion
that
seen
homes
across
the
world
seen
the
stadium
and
the
pitch
during
each
matchday
every
major
stadium
world
football
packed
each
weekend
with
fans
that
would
anything
for
their
club
and
players
that
would
the
same
other
sport
the
world
can
rival
the
passion
during
matches
and
the
week
leading
each
match
every
week
world
football
rivalry
matches
one
the
best
times
during
each
football
season
when
two
bitter
rivals
face
off
against
each
other
these
rivalry
matches
are
separate
from
the
crosstown
derby
matches
but
they
create
the
same
hate
and
passion
toward
the
opposing
clubs
perfect
example
this
would
the
manchester
united
liverpool
matches
that
showcase
two
the
most
successful
clubs
english
football
other
rivalries
get
created
through
continental
matchups
like
barcelona
manchester
united
two
the
last
four
uefa
champions
league
finals
these
rivalries
not
only
add
intrigue
the
buildup
each
match
but
they
also
add
the
play
the
pitch
each
rivalry
match
played
world
football
the
impetus
the
players
from
both
clubs
raised
above
their
normal
level
age
limit
all
the
primary
american
professional
sports
require
their
athletes
certain
age
play
for
example
the
nfl
has
policy
that
players
have
three
years
out
high
school
before
entering
the
nfl
draft
the
nba
players
must
year
removed
from
high
school
before
entering
the
draft
world
football
there
are
age
requirements
for
players
take
the
pitch
once
club
thinks
player
ready
play
first
team
football
they
will
throw
that
player
out
the
pitch
the
latest
examples
this
process
are
raheem
sterling
liverpool
and
luke
shaw
southampton
both
players
made
their
debuts
the
age
this
season
and
impressed
their
fans
with
spectacular
performances
sterling
shaw
were
american
football
basketball
players
they
would
not
able
represent
their
teams
until
the
age
the
earliest
historic
stadiums
america
you
can
barely
find
historic
stadiums
that
were
built
over
century
ago
across
europe
and
south
america
that
the
custom
for
football
stadiums
palatial
stadiums
like
anfield
old
trafford
camp
nou
maracana
azteca
and
the
bernabeu
have
stood
for
years
and
will
going
nowhere
anytime
soon
every
time
football
fan
steps
into
one
those
wonderful
stadiums
sense
awe
and
wonderment
fill
the

relegation
one
the
most
unique
facets
world

have
their
worst
three

instead
the
reward
high

like
american
sports
the
worst

world
football
are
forced

the
relegation
system
truly
unique
and
makes

relish
the
opportunity
