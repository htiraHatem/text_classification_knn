entered
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
argued
tuesday
the
federal
government
was
distracted
the
democratic
led
impeachment
trial
president
trump
when
the
coronavirus
outbreak
began
mcconnell
gave
credit
sen
tom
cotton
ark
for
paying
attention
the
severity
the
outbreak
time
when
the
senate
whole
was
occupied

aid
bill
wish
shed
turn
off
those
political
talking
points
was
first
and
think
tom
was
right
the
mark
and
came
while
were
tied
down
the
impeachment
trial
mcconnell
said
hugh
hewitts
radio
program
and
think
diverted
the
attention
the
government
because
everything
every
day
was
all
about
impeachment
but
tom
figured
this
out
early
and
was
absolutely
right
former
mcconnell
aide
john
ashbrook
also
pointed
this
out
tuesday
stating
that
the
pandemic
believed
have
hit
the
united
states
the
same
day
that
house
democrats
marched
articles
impeachment
the
senate
after
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
held
off
moving
forward
impeachment
for
weeks
the
senate
majority
leader
took
another
dig
pelosi
for
playing
partisan
politics
time
that
both
parties
had
been
working
together
for
common
goal
noting
how
soon
this
took
place
after
partisan
impeachment
process
think
you
know
what
really
noteworthy
about
this
pivoted
from
the
most
partisan
thing
you
could
possibly
involved
the
impeachment
president
unanimous
vote
trillion
dollar
package
all
within
couple
months
said
did
have
outbreak
you
know
kind
the
old
fashioned
impeachment
partisanship
which
think
was
generated
the
speaker
trying
you
know
get
into
the
senate
process
